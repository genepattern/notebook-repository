# GenePattern Notebook Repository

This repository contains a webservice used to share, publish and preview Jupyter Notebooks.
It is intended for use with with [JupyterHub's Services API](http://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/).
Also contained in this repository is an nbextensions which provides a front end for this
service and a variety of associated scripts and other code are used in the daily operation
and maintenance of the [GenePattern Notebook Repository](https://notebook.genepattern.org).

### GenePattern Notebook Repository

This free resource allows users to create, run and share notebooks using the [GenePattern Notebook Environment](http://genepattern-notebooks.org).

### GenePattern Server

GenePattern is a powerful platform for reproducible bioinformatics research. It
provides hundreds of analytical tools for the analysis of gene expression (RNA-seq and
microarray), sequence variation and copy number, proteomic, flow cytometry, and
network analysis. For more information visit:

* [GenePattern website](http://genepattern.org)
* [GenePattern server GitHub repository](https://github.com/genepattern/genepattern-server)

### GenePattern Notebook

The [GenePattern Notebook](https://github.com/genepattern/genepattern-notebook)
environment gives GenePattern users the ability to interleave text, graphics, and code
with their GenePattern analyses to create "notebooks" that can be edited, shared, and
published. GenePattern Notebooks are built on the Jupyter Notebook system  and extend
it, allowing researchers to embed the hundreds of genomic analysis and machine learning
methods in GenePattern within a notebook, without the need to write code. For more
