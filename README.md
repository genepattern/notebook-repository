# GenePattern Notebook Repository
The associated scripts and other code are used in the daily operation and maintenance 
of the [GenePattern Notebook Repository](https://notebook.genepattern.org). 
This repository allows users to create, run and share notebooks using the 
[GenePattern Notebook Environment](http://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/genepattern-notebooks).

GenePattern is a powerful platform for reproducible bioinformatic research. It 
provides hundreds of analytical tools for the analysis of gene expression (RNA-seq and 
microarray), sequence variation and copy number, proteomic, flow cytometry, and 
network analysis. For more information visit the [GenePattern website](http://genepattern.org).

The [GenePattern Notebook](https://github.com/genepattern/genepattern-notebook) 
environment gives GenePattern users the ability to interleave text, graphics, and code 
with their GenePattern analyses to create "notebooks" that can be edited, shared, and 
published. GenePattern Notebooks are built on the Jupyter Notebook system  and extend 
it, allowing researchers to embed the hundreds of genomic analysis and machine learning 
methods in GenePattern within a notebook, without the need to write code. This is built
on top of the [GenePattern Python client](https://github.com/genepattern/genepattern-python).
